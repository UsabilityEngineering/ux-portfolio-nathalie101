#Building my first PC

By Nathalie Rios 10/13/2023

Part 1: The Research
Before I started purchasing, I started researching the basic parts needed and how powerful I needed them to be. I looked for beginner-friendly guides, watched countless YouTube/tiktok videos on tutorials and pc/desk setups. Understanding the basic components of a computer, such as the motherboard, CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage. This part was probably the month lengthy  because I did not want to regret any purchases. My main goal for my pc was to have it run all the autodesk applications I need, render 3d models, and run adobe suite applications smoothly at the same time. Also to have the flexibility to game in the future. Also, most importantly, for it to turn on.  
Part 2: Gathering of Components
With a list of components in hand, I set out to gather the necessary parts on Amazon. Now, when building a pc I you should know you are buying not the parts of a computer that you typically buy in one piece. So, choosing the right components was overwhelming. I carefully selected each piece based on my needs and budget. I opted for a powerful CPU for smooth multitasking, a high-performance GPU for gaming and content creation, ample RAM for seamless multitasking, and a lightning-fast SSD for quick system boot and application loading times.


Part 3: The Build
The orders came in and it was time to put theory into practice. Armed with whatever complimentary tools the parts came with, I laid out all my components on the dining room table. Step by step, I followed the motherboard and case manual. To my surprise the case manual was very **useful** and beginner friendly. It had nice diagramatic pictures on how to take your case apart and where some of your things should go like the power supply. Thanks to that, I didn’t struggle much in applying certain parts.

I started with the motherboard and began to put in the pieces on it before attaching it into the case. The website for the motherboard was what I used the most to find out where things were going, specifically this labeled picture. 
I looked at what part I was holding and simply placed it with its designated spot by its name. 
The first component I installed was the CPU because it was the most approachable part to install. All I had to do was move a lever, plop it in, and lock the lever in. 
Next were SSDs which were these flimsy things that would not lay flat and it took me like 30 minutes to realize that mine came with teeny screws to fix that like the videos I watched. I had previously thought mine did not come with them for some reason. 

Ram was nice since there were plenty of videos for that and it had a satisfying click when installed properly. It served as great user feedback for an overthinking beginner(me). They also lit up once connected to the power supply so that was also helpful. 
 
I installed the GPU when I removed it because it made the motherboard too massive for the pc case. Doing that was so stressful because I had to put some of my WEIGHT to secure it in and then I had to TUG on it to take it out. So, I decided to install the cooler first. 
The manual for the cooler was also really **useful**. It had instructions for both AMD and INTEL installations. 
The cooler had the Intel part preinstalled. Mine was AMD. There was confusion. I eventually figured out that the AMD part was lying in the box. I switched out the part. I started to overthink about thermal paste when in fact it already had thermal paste pre applied. It was getting late.

Once the motherboard was secured to the case it was time to install the gpu. I had to move some pieces of the case and tilt the gpu to get the sides to fit in then straighten it into its designated spot. I looked up pictures and videos to make sure I was installing all the parts correctly for all the parts. I mainly followed along with a youtuber that had a nicely detailed and evenly paced pc building tutorial that helped understand the mechanics of the parts. 


Thankfully nearly all components had some form of **user feedback** to indicate whether it was fully installed. Some made a clicking noise or I would plug in the power supply to see if the parts that had rgb lights would turn on. Placing everything felt like piecing together a puzzle. It was the wiring that didn’t match my **mental model** or how I thought it would work. 
The wires had labels but for some reason it was difficult to correlate them to the outlet things. It got to a point where I put in a prong to something that looked like it matched, turned the pc on and it almost immediately started to smoke. I turned it off right away and I have yet to notice anything bad with my pc right now so I don’t think I damaged anything.  Then, by some miracle I came across ___’s video. I followed nearly every detail of that video. Thanks to that I was able to find a spot for everything. 
Part 4 Does it turn on though?
After an eternity(it was a week), the moment of truth arrived. I plugged in the power cable,  pressed the power button. To my immense relief and delight, the system turned on The fans whirred, the lights blinked, and my monitor displayed the BIOS screen
Conclusion: Weaknesses and suggestions
Honestly, after figuring everything out myself it all felt very obvious. In my case I’d say the motherboard was the weakest in terms of learnability. It didn’t come with a manual which would have been helpful to know what goes where and what that could look like just so people like me could have a general idea. Luckily some of the parts had them.  Also the wires didn’t come with instructions at all. I don’t know how I would’ve figured it out without YouTube. So, instructions with pictures and describing what the letters/labels on it mean would also be helpful.
